      ## The Problem

      Most website builders are either too expensive (monthly fees) or too complex (maintenance) for small, volunteer-run organizations.

      ## Our Solution

      We use a "White Label" factory model. We've built a master template using **Next.js** and **TinaCMS**. This allows us to deploy a unique, professional site for your organization in minutes, with **zero monthly hosting fees**.

      ## Open Source

      LocalCause is built in public. Our code is open, transparent, and built to last.
